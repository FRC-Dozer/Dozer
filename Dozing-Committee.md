# Dozing Committee

## Membership
Membership in the Dozing Committee can come one of two ways: 
 - Any FRC Team may nominate one of their members to be part of the Dozing Committee
 - 75% of Dozing Committee members must vote to allow a new member in.

## Responsibilities
The Dozing Committee is responsible for the vision and planning of Dozer. 

The Dozing Committee will select day to day maintainers of Dozer, and will create and edit contribution guidelines as they see fit. The Dozing Committee will also set the goals and roadmap for the development and maintenance of Dozer.

The Dozing Comittee will also appoint mods for the Dozer Discord Server

The first Sunday of each month, the Dozing Comittee will create a document outlining the changes made to Dozer during that month, any changes in mods, maintainers or committee membership, and current roadmap for the development and maintenance of Dozer.

The Dozing Committee is encouraged to openly discuss these issues informally on the Dozer Discord Server to ensure transparancy and solicit community feedback.
## Notes
There isn't much to the Dozing Committee, it's just a body of people that have a vision for what needs to get done for Dozer and how.
It has few formal rules governing it to allow it to make its own rules for the given situation.
The Dozing Committee should lead by example and servant leadership ideally,
and its monthly document just a recap of what has already been discussed amongst itself and the rest of the community already. 
Hopefully, outside of those documents, people should forget that it's even there,
as its members simply discuss and contribute to the project like anyone else would.
