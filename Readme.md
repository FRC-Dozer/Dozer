### Prerequisites

You'll need a copy of the latest build of WPILib from FRC, either as an [Eclipse plugin](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/599679-installing-eclipse-c-java) or as a [Maven artifact](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/wpilib_source/l/480976-maven-artifacts)

### Installing
##### Eclipse Plugins
Add our built jar archive to `USER_HOME\wpilib\user\java\lib`(`C:\Users\USERNAME` on Windows). This jar file will be available to all existing and future projects that are built with WPILib in Eclipse, and will be packaged automatically into the deploy task.

##### Maven Artefact
(Support coming soon)


## Built With

* [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib) - The Robot Library this project is based on.
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* Zoominfo's Java Generators - A sadly abandoned implementation of lazy generators in java, used to handle coroutines.
