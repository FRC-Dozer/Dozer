### Prerequisites

You'll need a copy of the latest build of WPILib from FRC, either as an [Eclipse plugin](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/599679-installing-eclipse-c-java) or as a [Maven artifact](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/wpilib_source/l/480976-maven-artifacts)

### Installing
##### Eclipse Plugins
Add our built jar archive to `USER_HOME\wpilib\user\java\lib`(`C:\Users\USERNAME` on Windows). This jar file will be available to all existing and future projects that are built with WPILib in Eclipse, and will be packaged automatically into the deploy task. Make sure to also add it to your IDE's classpath

##### Maven Artefact
(Support coming soon)
